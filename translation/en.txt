[00:14.83] "What kind of person are you?"
[00:18.36] If only I could ask like that
[00:22.15] On summer days when I feel pushed from behind
[00:26.19] Let us become flowers that sway vividly
[00:30.32] I want to be as cool as a polar bear
[00:33.77] But this passion only grows stronger.
[00:38.27] 
[00:38.37] My heart is pounding wildly right now
[00:41.55] Have the courage to speak up
[00:45.86] I'm finally starting to fall for you
[00:49.40] I want you to notice me.
[00:53.37] Love love, Fall in love with love.
[00:57.03] We're just like that, you know. We're human, after all.
[01:00.90] Love turned inside out Deliberately falling in love
[01:04.67] They're just like us. Human beings.
[01:09.67] "This is the kind of person I am"
[01:08.56] 
[01:11.92] If only I could say that
[01:15.70] Lonely nights spent with my head in my hands
[01:19.65] A flower swaying richly
[01:23.91] I want to be as bold as a wolf.
[01:27.67] But I can't find that confidence anywhere.
[01:31.61] With a distinct bitterness that throbs
[01:35.06] Summon the courage to reach out
[01:39.38] If my heart stirs, I'll fall for you
[01:43.09] I want you to look at me.
[01:46.97] I want you to notice me.
[01:51.00] Through encounters, I come to know true love
[01:54.63] I'm just human, you know
[01:58.41] I know both mischief and sorrow The meaning of wanting to be with you
[02:02.11] Teaching is my life
[02:06.11] 
[02:21.28] Coincidence? Destiny? Romance strikes unexpectedly.
[02:25.00] Pops is fresh Hey la la la...
[02:28.76] I met you, who felt like "destiny"
[02:32.66] It's definitely not just youthful folly.
[02:38.75] Day by day, cracks appear and my heart shatters
[02:42.15] I lose both courage and confidence,
[02:46.48] Though discouraged, I can live on with strength
[02:50.12] Every day is about growing up.
[02:53.72] Love love, Fall in love with love.
[02:57.53] We're just human, after all.
[03:01.48] Love love, Fall in love with greatness.
[03:05.03] We're human too, you know.
[03:09.10] The brief spring is coming to an end
[03:12.82] The short summer is coming to an end.
[03:16.63] Living in a new era I'm falling for you
[03:24.08] I just want you to notice me.
[03:28.07] I want you to notice me.
